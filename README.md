_description in Russian [here](README.ru.md)_

Adds a button to the toolbar in the administrative part of the site on the page for editing the item to view the item on the front of the site.

Works correctly for materials and categories, menu items. Also works for any component that has **id** for each element, and the layout for editing is called **edit**.

If the name of the view in the administrative part does not match the name of the front view, then the generation of the correct link is not guaranteed.

A sef link is generated.
